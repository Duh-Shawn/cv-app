React app created using state and props. 

Users are able to submit several different sections that display information about themselves, similiar to a tradational resume. Users are able to provide personal information (name, email address, phone number), education details (school, degree, graduation year) and work experience (company, title, date started).

After adding additonal blocks, users are able to hover over them to edit the information contained inside them or to delete the block itself.
